start creating your first template

template: 
A CloudFormation template is a JSON or YAML formatted text file. 
You can save these files with any extension, such as .json, .yaml, .template, or .txt. 
CloudFormation uses these templates as blueprints for building your AWS resources.

stack:
When you use CloudFormation, you manage related resources as a single unit called a stack. 
You create, update, and delete a collection of resources by creating, updating, and deleting stacks. 
All the resources in a stack are defined by the stack's CloudFormation template
Suppose you created a template that includes an Auto Scaling group, Elastic Load Balancing load balancer,
and an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database instance. To create those resources, 
you create a stack by submitting the template that you created, and CloudFormation provisions all those resources for you.


changeset:
If you need to make changes to the running resources in a stack, you update the stack. 
Before making changes to your resources, you can generate a change set, which is a summary of 
your proposed changes. Change sets allow you to see how your changes might impact your running 
resources, especially for critical resources, before implementing them.

3 ways to create stack

1: from UI
go to cloudformation dashboard uplaod teplmate and create stack


2: Using AWS CLI

install aws cli
configure profile
aws configure --profile abc

to create stack
aws cloudformation create-stack --profile=nk --stack-name myteststack --template-body file://template.yaml

to delete stack
aws cloudformation delete-stack --profile=nk --stack-name myteststack 

3: using Create stack API



We can add resources in a diagram and generate template as required
